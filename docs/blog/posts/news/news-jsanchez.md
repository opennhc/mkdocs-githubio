We are working on an amazing set of features which has required some behind-the-scenes work we are now ready to share in a series of posts. Here, we give an overview of our goals, features in the making, things that kept us up at night, and our commitment to Open Source.

We know it's been quite a while since our last update, which is why we're eager to share what's happening in and around Material for MkDocs with you. For the largest part of 2024, we've been focused on transforming the core of Material for MkDocs preparing the ground for new, interconnected features that are amongst the most frequently requested.

This article is the first in a series where we'll explore how we aim to support our users through improved information retrieval, provide better support for multi-lingual sites and versioning, as well as improve the overall authoring experience. We outline our vision for the projects' evolution and describe what we have been working on. In this and the coming blog posts, we will share our progress with you, and we're excited to hear your thoughts.
